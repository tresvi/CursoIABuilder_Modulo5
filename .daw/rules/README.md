# DAW — The Method

## What DAW is

DAW is a **structured development pipeline for AI agents** (Claude Code, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI,
Cursor, Gemini CLI, OpenCode). It defines a
state machine that walks the agent step by step through a complete development cycle: from
understanding what has to be done, to shipping the code with a commit, a PR and a closed ticket.

### The problem it solves

AI agents have three recurring problems when working on code:

1. **They skip steps** — straight to writing code, without understanding requirements or planning.
2. **They lose context** — in long sessions they forget earlier decisions or the state of the work.
3. **They get overloaded** — give them every rule at once and they follow some and ignore the rest.

### The solution

DAW implements three mechanisms:

- **A state machine**: the agent can only be in one phase at a time, with explicit allowed and
  blocked actions.
- **Lazy loading**: each phase loads only the relevant instructions, avoiding context overload.
- **Blocking gates**: you cannot advance a phase without meeting verifiable conditions (tests
  passing, clean SAST, the user's approval).

## Work Classification

When the user makes a request, CLASSIFY sorts it into one of two families:

**Stateless** — `QUERY` (an informational question, read-only). It is resolved inside IDLE: it
does **not** modify `.daw-state.json`, does not start a phase, and is not recorded in the `tier`
field. A request that has nothing to do with the repo's code is not classified at all: DAW governs
what happens to the code, not everything you are asked for.

**Stateful** — `QUICK-FIX`, `FIX`, `FEATURE`, `DISCOVERY`. They record a `tier` in
the state and advance through phases. FIX/FEATURE walk the full pipeline; QUICK-FIX takes
a short subset (`CLASSIFY → DEFINE → CODE → RELEASE`, skipping PLAN and VERIFY); DISCOVERY has its
own ideation flow (`CLASSIFY → DISCOVERY`).

### Tiers (canonical table)

| Tier | What it is | Pipeline | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `QUERY` | An informational question | none (stateless) | Read-only. Does not touch the state. |
| `QUICK-FIX` | A ≤ 10 LOC change with no attack surface | `CLASSIFY → DEFINE → CODE → RELEASE` | Artifact: a 4-line fix-brief. SAST still blocks. Guarded by the shared gate, on every tool. |
| `FIX` | A defect in existing behavior, including a live production bug | the full pipeline | Fix-plan instead of a spec with blocks. Requires an RCA, a regression test and a rollback plan. |
| `FEATURE` | New functionality | the full pipeline | PRD + spec with blocks + scope control. |
| `DISCOVERY` | Ideation, no implementation | `CLASSIFY → DISCOVERY` | Produces a concept + validated PRDs. No code. |

QUICK-FIX is evaluated FIRST, using a mechanical 5-criteria heuristic (≤ 10 LOC, 1 code file, no
sensitive paths, no new files, no new dependencies). If any criterion fails, classification
continues normally. See `classify.instructions.md`.

> ℹ️ Tier names are written to the state as **enum identifiers** — they are what the FSM and
> `transition-graph.json` validate against, not display text.

## Pipeline

```
CLASSIFY → DEFINE → PLAN → CODE → VERIFY → RELEASE → IDLE
```

Every `→` transition requires the user's explicit approval.

Six phases. CLASSIFY is not numbered in the status line, so the numbering the agent shows you
runs over the other five: DEFINE(1) → PLAN(2) → CODE(3) → VERIFY(4) → RELEASE(5).

| Phase | What it does | Exit gate |
|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **CLASSIFY** | Classifies the tier, reads the stack, assigns a ticket and creates the branch | The user confirms the classification |
| **DEFINE** | Writes/reviews the PRD, controls scope | The user approves the PRD |
| **PLAN** | Designs the technical solution, writes the spec/fix-plan to disk | Spec approved + threat model |
| **CODE** | Implements block by block, writes tests | Tests pass + clean SAST |
| **VERIFY** | Cross-verification against the PRD and the spec, written to a report | verify-module passes |
| **RELEASE** | Commit, PR, tracker update | The user confirms the closeout |

### Behavior by tier in each phase

| Phase | FEATURE | FIX |
|-------|---------|-----|
| **CLASSIFY** | Classifies, assigns FEAT-NNN | Classifies, assigns FIX-NNN |
| **DEFINE** | Full PRD + scope control | Root cause analysis + reviews PRDs, gate if there is a gap |
| **PLAN** | Spec with blocks + threat modeling | Fix-plan + rollback plan + threat modeling |
| **CODE** | Block by block from the spec | Steps from the fix-plan, stability first |
| **VERIFY** | verify-module | verify-module |
| **RELEASE** | Commit + PR + tracker | Commit + PR + tracker |

> **QUICK-FIX** and **DISCOVERY** are not in this table (which compares FEATURE and FIX):
> QUICK-FIX uses the short pipeline (DEFINE = fix-brief, CODE = tests + SAST, no PLAN and no
> VERIFY), and DISCOVERY does not walk the pipeline at all. See the tier table above.

## Control Mechanisms

### 1. Lazy loading
The router (the "Phase Router" section of `orchestrator.md`) defines which instruction files load in
each phase. The agent **never** loads instructions from a phase other than the current one.

### 2. Blocking gates
- **SAST** (CODE phase): `daw-security-sast` must pass before advancing to VERIFY.
- **Tests**: the full suite must pass before leaving CODE.
- **User approval**: every phase transition is confirmed by the user.

### 3. Multi-session persistence
The state is stored in `.daw-state.json`. If a session is interrupted, the next one picks up where
it left off. Block-by-block progress is tracked in the state's `block` field.

### 4. Self-check
The agent verifies its own state before every write action. If it detects an inconsistency between
what it is doing and the current phase, it stops and reports.

## Version

The method does not carry a number of its own. There is **one** product version —
`CHANGELOG.md` states it and every manifest repeats it — and each rule file
carries its own in its frontmatter, bumped when that file changes.

A third number here said `2.2.0` while the product said `1.0.0`, and nothing
compared them, so it drifted for as long as it existed. `CONTRIBUTING.md` has the
rule and `scripts/check_versions.py` enforces it.
