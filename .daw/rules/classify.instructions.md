# CLASSIFY Phase (Recognition and Classification)

**Goal:** understand the codebase, classify the user's request, and prepare the state for the
pipeline.

---

## Step 1: Project stack

The stack lives in **`AGENTS.md`**, section "Stack". **That is the only place.** No derived file is
generated: duplicating the stack across two files guarantees that at some point they will say
different things.

**Protocol:**

1. **Read the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`.**
2. **If it is complete** → use it and skip to Step 2. There is nothing else to do.
3. **If it is empty or still has unfilled placeholders:**
   - **If the repo has configuration files** (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`,
     `build.gradle`, `Gemfile`, etc.): scan them, detect language, framework, test runner, linter,
     ORM/DB and package manager, and **hand the user the finished text to paste into `AGENTS.md`**:

     ```
     Your AGENTS.md does not declare the stack. Here is what I detected in the repo:

     | Field | Value |
     |-------|-------|
     | Language | [detected] |
     | ...      | ...       |

     Shall I add this to the "Stack" section of your AGENTS.md?
     ```

     With the user's confirmation, write it **into `AGENTS.md`** and continue.
   - **If the repo has NO configuration files** (a new project, no code yet): **STOP**. There is
     nothing to detect, and you cannot plan or implement blind.

     ```
     I need the stack to work, and your AGENTS.md does not have it yet.
     Fill in the "Stack" section of AGENTS.md and we start over.
     ```

**Hard rule:** the stack is **written once, in `AGENTS.md`**, and the user always confirms it. DAW
can detect it and propose it — never assume it, never store it somewhere else.

### Step 1.1: Does the stack cover what this repo actually does?

A declared stack can be complete and still leave DAW running the wrong commands: the repo has a
linter DAW was never told about, or a CI job that runs something no gate will.

Invoke `Skill(skill="daw-context-check")`. Once per ticket, here, because this is the last moment
before the pipeline starts spending time on the wrong commands.

**It does not block.** It reports what the repo declares and the context file does not, with the
evidence and the line to add. The user accepts, declines, or ignores it, and the answer is recorded
so it is not asked again for this ticket. If there is nothing to report it says one line and gets out
of the way. Do not turn its findings into gates, and do not treat a decline as a reason to stop:
whether a project should run a linter is not DAW's call.

---

## Step 2: Tier Classification

Analyze the user's request:

### QUERY (Stateless)
The user asks something informational, without requesting code changes.
- Examples: "how does X work?", "where is the file that does Y?", "explain this function to me"
- **Action:** answer directly. Do not touch `.daw-state.json`. Do not change phase. Done.

> **Anything that is not about the repo's code is not classified at all.** Drafting an email,
> putting a deck together, summarizing a sprint: do it and move on, with no tier, no state and no
> tool restrictions. DAW governs what happens to the code, not everything you are asked for.

### QUICK-FIX (cross-cutting modifier)

**Evaluate FIRST, before FIX/FEATURE.** A mechanical heuristic over the expected diff
(estimated from the user's description and the likely paths):

1. ≤ 10 LOC modified.
2. 1 code file, or several only if they are docs/comments.
3. Does NOT touch: schemas, migrations, HTTP endpoints, authentication, authorization, input
   validation, or paths marked as security-sensitive in `AGENTS.md` ("Stack" section).
4. Does NOT add new files.
5. Does NOT introduce dependencies.

If **ALL** hold → `tier="QUICK-FIX"`. If **any** fails → continue with the normal classification
(FIX / FEATURE).

- Valid examples: fixing a typo in a log message, adjusting a comment, changing a non-sensitive
  constant's value.
- Short pipeline: `CLASSIFY → DEFINE → CODE → RELEASE` (skips PLAN and VERIFY). Only artifact: a
  4-line fix-brief. Only security validation: SAST.
- Safeguard: if during CODE something tries to write a sensitive path or the diff exceeds 10 LOC,
  the shared gate blocks and asks you to abandon the ticket and reclassify
  it as a FIX (escalating means a new ticket, a new branch and an RCA — it is not a step backwards
  inside the same flow).

### FIX
Meets ALL of these criteria:
- Fixes a bug or defect in existing behavior
- Does NOT change behavior visible to the end user
- Does NOT modify public interfaces (APIs, schemas, exported types)
- Does NOT change architecture
- Examples: a typo in logic, a query correction, a config adjustment, fixing broken validation,
  a live production bug

A FIX always gets a **root cause analysis** in DEFINE (`docs/daw/specs/rca-{ticket}.md`) and a
**rollback plan** in its fix-plan. That is what separates it from QUICK-FIX: a QUICK-FIX is too
small to have a root cause worth writing down or a revert worth planning.

### FEATURE
Meets ANY of these criteria:
- Adds new user-visible functionality
- Modifies a public API or a data schema
- Changes navigation flows or UX
- Introduces a new architectural dependency
- Requires a data migration
- Examples: a new endpoint, a new page, a module refactor, integrating an external service

### DISCOVERY
Meets ANY of these criteria:
- The user wants to explore an idea without implementing code yet
- The PM or user wants functionality defined at a high level
- PRDs need to be created for a new project or product
- The request is vague/broad and needs refining before it becomes executable tickets
- The goal is to plan how to split a large project into implementable features
- Examples: "I want to build a marketplace", "I need to define the features of a CRM", "I have this
  idea and want to turn it into PRDs", "the PM wants the requirements for X documented"

**Difference from FEATURE:** FEATURE will implement code. DISCOVERY only produces documentation
(concept + PRDs). DISCOVERY's PRDs can later be executed as individual FEATURE tickets.

### When in doubt
Ask the user: "Does this change what the user sees or how they interact with the system? Is it
urgent because of production impact? Does it change the architecture? Or are you exploring an idea
and want to define it before implementing?"

---

## Step 2.1: Stop for stateless classifications

If the classification is **QUERY**:
- Answer per the rule defined above.
- **Do NOT continue to Steps 3 through 6.** Those steps only apply to the stateful tiers
  (QUICK-FIX, FIX, FEATURE, DISCOVERY).
- Do not touch `.daw-state.json`. Do not change phase. Done.

---

## Step 3: Ticket

### First: is this continuing a split PRD?

Before asking anything, list `docs/daw/prd/`. A file named `prd-{TICKET}{letter}.md` whose ticket has
no closeout in `history` is work that was already defined and never run — and if the user just said
something like *"continue with the PRD"* or *"the next one"*, that is almost certainly what they
mean.

When there is one, **propose it instead of running the intake from scratch**:

```
This looks like FEAT-001b — "[title from its PRD]", the next sub-ticket of FEAT-001.
Its PRD is already written. Continue with it?
```

On confirmation: `ticket` = the sub-ticket ID, `title` from its PRD, `tracker` inherited from the
parent, and **the tier is the parent's** — a split does not reclassify the work, it divides it.
Then carry on with step 4.

Two things not to do. Do not invent a fresh `FEAT-NNN` for work that already has a PRD: you end up
with two tickets for one deliverable and the parent index pointing at neither. And do not skip
DEFINE — the PRD gets re-validated there, always, for the reasons that phase gives.

If the user is clearly asking for something else, say what is pending in one line and get on with
what they asked. This is a proposal, not a redirection.

### Then, for new work

If the tier is stateful (QUICK-FIX, FIX, FEATURE or DISCOVERY):

1. Ask: "Is there an associated tracker ticket? If so, which one?"
2. **If the user provides a tracker ticket** (e.g. `PROJ-123`):
   - `ticket` = the tracker ID (e.g. `"PROJ-123"`)
   - `title` = the tracker ticket's title
   - `tracker` = the tracker ID (same value as `ticket`)
   - Every artifact, path and status line will use this ID.
3. **If there is no tracker ticket:**
   - Ask: "Do you want me to propose a tracker ticket for this?"
     - If yes → propose one per `.daw/rules/tracker.instructions.md`. If it gets created, apply
       rule 2.
     - If no → generate a sequential internal ID (`FIX-NNN`, `FEAT-NNN` or `DISC-NNN`).
       `tracker` = `null`.

---

## Step 4: Presenting to the User

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CLASSIFY — Classification                               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                          │
│  Classification: [TIER]                                  │
│  Reason: [one line explaining why]                       │
│  Mode: [full pipeline / short lane / free ideation]      │
│  Ticket: [PROJ-XXX with a tracker / FIX-NNN without]     │
│  Source: [tracker / internal]                            │
│  Title: [tracker ticket title, or generated]             │
│  Stack: [reference to AGENTS.md ("Stack" section)]       │
│                                                          │
│  Do you confirm this classification?                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Wait for explicit confirmation **of this specific classification**. Generic phrases like "go ahead",
"next one", "continue" said in the context of ANOTHER ticket do NOT constitute approval of this
classification. The user has to answer THIS table.

If the user objects:
1. Briefly explain your reasoning.
2. If they insist → accept the reclassification.

---

## Step 5: Create the Working Branch

Only after the user confirms, **BEFORE updating the state:**

1. Create the branch per `.daw/rules/branches.instructions.md`:
   - FEATURE → `feat/<ticket>-<short-name>`
   - FIX and QUICK-FIX → `fix/<ticket>-<short-name>`
   - DISCOVERY → `discovery/<ticket>-<short-name>`
2. Confirm to the user: "Branch created: `[name]`"

**Reason:** starting in DEFINE, artifacts are written to disk (PRDs, RCAs). Everything must live on
the ticket's branch, never on `main`.

---

## Step 6: Transition

1. Update `.daw-state.json`:
   - `tier` → the confirmed tier (`"QUICK-FIX"`, `"FIX"`, `"FEATURE"` or
     `"DISCOVERY"`)
   - `phase`:
     - For `QUICK-FIX`, `FIX`, `FEATURE` → `"DEFINE"`
     - For `DISCOVERY` → `"DISCOVERY"`
   - `ticket` → the tracker ID if there is one (e.g. `"PROJ-123"`), or a sequential internal ID
     (e.g. `"FIX-001"`, `"DISC-001"`)
   - `title` → the tracker ticket's title if there is one, or the generated title
   - `tracker` → the tracker ID, or `null` when the ID is internal
   - Append a `history` entry for the transition CLASSIFY → DEFINE (or → DISCOVERY), **stamped
     with `ticket` and `tier`** (see `.daw/rules/state.instructions.md`). This is the first entry
     that can carry a ticket — the one before it left IDLE, where there was none yet.

2. **Build that write with the helper**, do not hand-assemble it:

   ```bash
   .daw/scripts/transition.py --to DEFINE --tier <TIER> --action "<why this tier>"
   ```

   It prints the complete next state and self-validates against the graph first, so an illegal
   transition fails here rather than being refused by the hook afterwards. Paste its output in a
   single write, filling in `ticket`, `title` and `tracker` in that same write — the helper does not
   set them, because free text through shell arguments is how quoting bugs get in.
