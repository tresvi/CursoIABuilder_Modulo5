"""DAW FSM transition validation.

Two modes (same graph, same `validate()`):

- `--mode pre` (PreToolUse, default): reads the event from stdin; if the target
  is .daw-state.json, validates disk→new (reconstructed from tool_input) BEFORE
  the write lands. Covers Edit|Write|NotebookEdit (the hook's matcher).
- `--mode post` (PostToolUse): ignores the event; revalidates the state ON DISK
  as a complete chain from IDLE (the `history` IS the chain, no external
  reference needed) after any tool — including Bash/jq, which the PreToolUse
  matcher never sees. Illegal → exit 2 (does not undo, it stops). Tool-agnostic,
  path-agnostic, stateless.

exit 0 = allow, exit 2 = block (with the reason on stderr). Validation is
anchored on the history entries that were APPENDED, not on the phase on disk:
the model does not always persist an intermediate CLASSIFY.

# so that the CLI below and daw/scripts/hook-gate.py — which is what the six
# tools actually run — cannot drift apart. They did: the caller had to opt into
# `max_appended`, and hook-gate did not, so one Write could declare the whole
# pipeline on every tool while this file's own CLI refused it.
#
# Both return None to allow, or a human-readable reason to refuse.

# ── What a gate rests on ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `validate()` asks whether a gate is claimed. That is a question about the state
# and nothing else, which is why it stays a pure function the suite can drive
# with synthetic runs. This asks the other question — whether anything outside
# the model backs the claim — and it needs the repository, so it lives out here
# where the root is known.
#
# Two gates have an answer. The other five are claims the machine sequences and
# records but cannot confirm, and that asymmetry is a decision rather than an
# unfinished job: docs/RATIONALE.md decision 16 says which are which and why.
