"""DAW's sanctioned FSM transition primitive.

Prints the COMPLETE JSON of the next .daw-state.json for ONE phase transition to
stdout, ready to paste into a `Write` tool call. Read-only: it does NOT write the
state. The actual write is done by the model with `Write`, which the PreToolUse
hook validates.

It builds the transition deterministically (reads the state from disk, appends
{timestamp, from, to, action} at the END of history, sets phase + gates) and
SELF-VALIDATES with the same validate() the hook uses before printing: if the
transition is illegal (an edge outside the graph, a missing gate, etc.) it exits
2 with the reason on stderr — the model sees the problem BEFORE writing, and no
JSON is emitted.

`from` = the phase read from disk (pre-mutation); `to` = --to. Run it ONCE per
edge: IDLE→CLASSIFY and CLASSIFY→DEFINE are separate runs (a direct IDLE→DEFINE
is not in the graph and gets rejected).

The ONLY metadata the helper sets is `--tier` (an enum — shell-safe, and the only
thing the FSM needs to route the graph). The other fields
(ticket/title/tracker, and the discovery object) are NOT handled here:
the model fills them in in the SAME Write where it pastes this output. Passing
free text (e.g. a title with spaces) through shell args broke the quoting, so
`--set` was removed.
