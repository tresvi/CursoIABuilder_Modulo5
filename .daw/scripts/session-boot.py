"""What every tool has to do when a session starts, written once.

Three things, none of them tool-specific:

  1. Materialize `.daw-state.json` if the repo does not have one yet, and keep
     the runtime files out of git.
  2. Warn when another session is already working in this same directory —
     there is ONE state file per directory, so two sessions clobber each other
     whatever tool they run under. The markers are shared across tools on
     purpose: Claude Code in one terminal and OpenCode in another are still two
     sessions on one state file.
  3. Tell the agent to read the orchestrator and run its boot sequence.

This lived three times, once per adapter, with the two-hour cutoff and the
marker protocol re-encoded each time and a different session-id key in each
copy. That is method logic, and method logic does not belong in an adapter.

    session-boot.py --repo /path/to/repo [--session-id X] [--format text|json]

`--format json` emits `{"additionalContext": "…"}` for the harnesses that read a
JSON verdict; the rest get plain text on stdout.
