# Skill: /daw-status

## Description
Reads `.daw-state.json` and prints a formatted summary of the current state. Read-only — it modifies
no file.

## Inputs
- `.daw-state.json`
- `docs/daw/prd/` — the directory listing only, to work out what is still unfinished

## Execution Protocol

1. Read `.daw-state.json` in full.
2. Derive the artifact paths from the ticket (they are not stored in the state).
3. **Work out the unfinished sub-tickets.** List `docs/daw/prd/`: a file named `prd-{TICKET}{letter}.md`
   is a sub-ticket of a split PRD. It is finished if `history` holds an entry with that `ticket`
   reaching `IDLE` by anything other than a pause. Everything else is still owed. Derived on the
   spot from two things already on disk — nothing about this is stored, and nothing needs to be.
4. Format and print the summary.

## Output Format

```

**Omit that last section entirely when there is no split PRD.** A panel that shows an empty block
every time teaches the reader to skip the place where the answer will eventually be.

Show only the gates that apply to the current tier. The names are the ones in
`transition-graph.json` — `define`, `spec`, `threat`, `tests`, `sast`, `verify`, `commit`, `pr` —
and nothing else is ever written to `gates`: a status panel that prints a gate no edge asks for
stays empty forever and teaches you to ignore the panel. QUICK-FIX has `define`, `tests`, `sast`,
`commit` and `pr`; DISCOVERY has only `commit` and `pr` (report the concept and the PRDs instead).
