## Description
Creates a new PRD (Product Requirements Document) or updates an existing one. The PRD defines WHAT
will be built: functional requirements, non-functional requirements, acceptance criteria, scope and
risks.

## Inputs
- The user's request (a description of the feature or change)
- Existing PRDs in `docs/daw/prd/` (to detect duplicates or to update)
- `.daw-state.json` (ticket, tier)
- The project's stack: the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`

## Execution Protocol

### Branch: tier = QUICK-FIX

If `.daw-state.json` has `tier == "QUICK-FIX"`, do NOT produce a full PRD. Produce a **4-line
fix-brief** and mark the `define` gate:

- **Path:** `docs/daw/prd/fix-{ticket}.md` (the same folder as the PRDs; the convention is defined in
  `.daw/rules/branches.instructions.md`).
- **Template:**

```markdown
# Fix {ticket}: {title}

- **Bug**: {one descriptive line}
- **Change**: {file}:{line} — {description of the modification}
- **Regression test**: {name of the test that reproduces the bug BEFORE and passes AFTER}
- **Risk**: none / {explain it if there is one}
```

- Validation: the 4 sections present and non-empty → verdict **PASS**. Do NOT run the `F-PRD-*`
  rules (see "Tier Modifier: QUICK-FIX" in `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md`).
- Set `gates.define = true` on the DEFINE→CODE transition.
- Do NOT invoke `daw-validate-prd` with FEATURE rules.

### Creation mode (new PRD)

1. Search `docs/daw/prd/` for an existing PRD covering this functionality.
   - If one exists and covers it partially → switch to update mode.
   - If one exists and covers it fully → tell the user; do not duplicate.
2. Talk with the user to disambiguate requirements. This phase is **exploratory and
   conversational** — do not use plan mode.
3. Produce the PRD from the standard template (below).
4. The filename is derived from the ticket: `prd-{ticket}.md` (e.g. `prd-FEAT-001.md`).
5. Run `daw-validate-prd` automatically.
6. If there are FAILs → fix them and increment `PRD loops`.
7. Present it to the user for approval.

### Update mode (existing PRD)

1. Read the existing PRD in full.
2. Identify which sections need changes.
3. Update in place — preserve whatever does not change.
4. Increment `PRD loops` in the header.
5. Run `daw-validate-prd` automatically.
6. Present the diff to the user for approval.

## PRD Template

```markdown
# PRD {ticket}: [Title]

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Ticket | [ticket] |
| Tracker | [tracker ticket or "none"] |
| Date | [timestamp] |
| PRD loops | 0 |

## Context and Problem
[Describe the problem being solved]

## Goals
[What we want to achieve]

## Functional Requirements
- FR-01: [atomic requirement]
- FR-02: [atomic requirement]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-01: [performance, security, etc. — always with a number]

## Acceptance Criteria
*(EARS — see `.daw/rules/validation-rules.instructions.md` §1 for the five patterns)*
- AC-01: WHEN [trigger], THE [system] SHALL [response].
- AC-02: IF [failure or misuse], THEN THE [system] SHALL [response].
- AC-03: ...

## Out of Scope
[What is explicitly NOT included]

## Risks and Mitigations
[Identified risks and how to mitigate them]

## Dependencies
[Other modules, services or features this depends on]
```

> The `FR-`/`NFR-`/`AC-` prefixes and the section names are what `daw-validate-prd` matches on
> (rules F-PRD-01 to F-PRD-09). Write the *content* in the user's language, but keep the identifiers
> and the structure as written here — **including the EARS keywords** (`WHEN`, `WHILE`, `WHERE`,
> `IF … THEN`, `SHALL`), which stay in English in every language, exactly as the section headings do.
> They are the shape the validator matches on; translated, the criterion still reads fine to a human
> and matches nothing.

## PRD Quality Rules

- **Atomic requirements:** each FR must describe a single verifiable action.
- **Acceptance criteria in EARS form.** One of the five patterns, every time (F-PRD-09). And **at
  least one `IF … THEN`** wherever the feature can fail, be misused, or depend on something that
  might not answer — that pattern exists for exactly the cases everyone forgets, and W-PRD-04 counts
  them. What nobody writes here is what nobody tests three phases later.
  *(Exceptions: DISCOVERY, which is exploratory, and QUICK-FIX, whose artifact is the fix-brief.)*
- **No ambiguity:** avoid "fast", "efficient", "easy" without concrete metrics.
- **Explicit Out of Scope:** what is NOT included matters as much as what is.
- **Examples:** include concrete examples for endpoints, validations and user flows.
- **Pagination, errors, validations:** always specify them where APIs are involved.

```

## Updating .daw-state.json
- `gates.define` → `true` once the user approves the PRD. The path is derived from the ticket:
  `docs/daw/prd/prd-{ticket}.md`.
- `gates.define` → `true` for tier QUICK-FIX, once the 4-section fix-brief is produced and
  validated. The path is derived from the ticket: `docs/daw/prd/fix-{ticket}.md`.

## Language

Write the PRD's content in the language the user is working in, keeping the identifiers and section
names above.
