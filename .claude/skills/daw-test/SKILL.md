# Skill: /daw-test

## Description
Runs the project's tests. Generates missing tests where needed. A blocking gate.

## Inputs
- Scope: an explicit argument, the modified files (`git diff`), or the full suite.
- `.daw/rules/testing.instructions.md` for the conventions.
- The spec/fix-plan, to know which tests are expected.
- The project's test runner: the "Stack" section of `AGENTS.md`.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Detect the scope:**
   - With an argument → run that module's/file's tests.
   - Post-block in CODE → run the block's tests.
   - In the closeout sequence → run the full suite.

2. **Check that the tests exist:**
   - For each modified logic file, check whether a corresponding test exists.
   - If it does not → generate one following `.daw/rules/testing.instructions.md`.
   - **Rule #0 applies to any test you generate:** a test that modifies data creates its own data in
     setup, only operates on what it created, and cleans up in teardown. Never destructive
     operations against existing environment data.

3. **Run the tests:**
   - Use the test runner command declared in `AGENTS.md` ("Stack" section).
   - Capture the full output.

4. **Analyze the results:**
   - On failure: work out whether the bug is in the test or in the code.
   - Fix and re-run. Max 3 attempts before reporting to the user.

## PASS/FAIL criteria
- **PASSED:** 0 failing tests → `gates.tests` = `true`.
- **BLOCKED:** 1+ failing tests → fix and re-run.

> This skill is a **runner**, not an artifact validator: it reports pass/fail. Test *quality*
> (coverage thresholds, AC traceability, sad paths) is evaluated in the VERIFY phase by
> `daw-verify-module`, against §5 of the rule catalog. A green suite here does not mean the tests
> are good enough — it means they pass.

## Updating .daw-state.json
- `gates.tests` → `true` on PASS in the closeout sequence.
