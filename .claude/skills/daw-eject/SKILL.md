  Copies the method out of the plugin and into this repository, so it can be read, edited and

# Skill: /daw-eject

## Description

Installed as a plugin, the method lives outside your repository — nothing of DAW's is in your tree,
which is what you want most of the time. **This copies it in.**

That matters the moment you want to change something. A pipeline you cannot edit is a pipeline you
have to accept whole, and the whole argument of this framework is that you should be deciding which
parts of it earn their cost in *your* project. Editing the plugin would change every project you
have; editing `.daw/` in your repo changes this one.

**The repo wins.** Every hook resolves the method as `.daw/` first, the plugin second, so the moment
this skill finishes there is nothing else to switch on. Your copy is the one that runs.

## When it is worth doing

- You want to **remove a phase or a gate** your project does not need.
- You want to **add a rule of your own**, or edit the wording of one that does not fit your domain.
- You want the pipeline **versioned with the project**, so a change to it lands in a commit and
  shows up in review like any other decision.
- Your team wants a teammate who clones the repo to get **exactly your pipeline**, not the current
  upstream default.

If none of those apply, do not do this. The plugin updating itself is a real benefit, and you give
it up here — see the trade below.

## Inputs

- The plugin's method directory (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/daw`, or the equivalent for your tool).
- The repository root.

## Execution Protocol

1. **Check there is something to eject.** If `.daw/` already exists in the repo, stop and say so:
   the method is already here, and the plugin is already being overridden. Offer `/daw-self-check`
   instead if they suspect it is stale.
2. **Say what will change, and wait.** This adds a directory to their repository — a small thing, but
   theirs, and they get to say no:

   ```
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │  /daw-eject — copy the method into this repo             │
   ├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │                                                          │
   │  From: [plugin root]/daw                                 │
   │  To:   .daw/            ([N] files)                      │
   │                                                          │
   │  After this:                                             │
   │    · This repo runs ITS copy. The plugin is ignored here │
   │    · You can edit any of it. It commits with your code   │
   │    · Plugin updates NO LONGER reach this repo            │
   │                                                          │
   │  Go ahead?                                               │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
   ```
3. **Copy** the method to `.daw/`. Nothing else moves: the wiring stays with the plugin, and the
   context file is untouched.
4. **Commit it** with `Skill(skill="daw-commit")` as a `🔧 chore`. A method sitting uncommitted is
   the one thing worse than not having ejected — the next `git checkout` takes it and nobody knows
   why the pipeline changed.
5. **Report** where it landed and what to read first: `.daw/rules/` for the phases,
   `.daw/rules/transition-graph.json` for what movements are legal.

## The trade, said plainly

| | Plugin | Ejected into the repo |
|---|---|---|
| Updates | `/plugin update`, once, everywhere | **Yours now.** Re-run the installer or merge by hand |
| Editing | Changes every project you have | Changes this one |
| A teammate who clones | Needs the plugin installed | **Gets your exact pipeline** |
| Your repo | Nothing of DAW's in it | `.daw/`, committed |

Neither is the right answer in general. The plugin is right while the default fits; ejecting is right
once it does not.

## PASS/FAIL criteria

- N/A. This is an action, not a validation.

## Updating .daw-state.json

- NONE. Where the method is read from is not part of the pipeline's state — it is resolved on every
  hook, from the filesystem.

## Language

Write the panel and the report in the language the user is working in.
