# Skill: /daw-commit

## Description
Creates a commit following Gitmoji + Conventional Commits, with mandatory AI attribution.

## Inputs
- The staged changes in git.
- `.daw-state.json` for the ticket and tier.
- `.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md` for the format and the gitmoji reference table.

## Execution Protocol

1. Run `git status` and `git diff --staged`.
2. If nothing is staged, look at the working tree:
   - **Dirty** → ask the user which files to include.
   - **Clean, in RELEASE** → there is nothing left to commit, because the earlier phases already
     committed their own artifacts. Do NOT manufacture an empty commit: run
     `git log <base>..HEAD --oneline`, show the branch's commits, and report the gate as satisfied
     by them.
   - **Clean, in any other phase** → this phase produced nothing to commit. Say so and stop.
3. Check there are no files carrying secrets (.env, credentials).
4. Check the gates **this phase's commit depends on**: in CODE, `tests` and `sast` must both be
   `true`. DEFINE, PLAN and DISCOVERY commit documentation and depend on no gate — at the moment
   they commit, the gate they are about to earn is not set yet, so demanding it would deadlock.
5. Analyze the changes to classify the type and scope.
6. Write the commit message with a gitmoji (see `.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md` for the
   reference table):

```
<gitmoji> <type>(<scope>): <description in the imperative> (<ticket, if there is one>)

<executive summary (if the change is large)>

Refs: <ticket>
AI-assisted: yes
```

   - Pick the gitmoji that describes the change (e.g. ✨ feat, 🐛 fix, 🚑 urgent fix, 🔒
     security, 🔥 delete, ⚡ perf). The full palette is available in any tier — the tier only
     provides the default when nothing fits better.
   - Include the tracker ticket in parentheses at the end of the first line if
     `.daw-state.json.tracker` is not null.

7. Present the message to the user for approval.
8. Only after approval → create the commit.
9. **NEVER push automatically.** Ask the user.

## Rules

Format, the gitmoji palette, trailers and prohibitions live in
`.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md`, which this skill already loads as an input. **They are not
restated here** — a rule written twice is a rule that will be changed once.

The two worth repeating, because they are about *this* skill's behaviour:

- **Never `git add .daw-state.json`.** It is the pipeline's runtime, it is gitignored, and a
  committed state file makes someone else's checkout claim your phase.
- **Never push automatically.** Ask.

## Updating .daw-state.json
- `gates.commit` → `true` **when this commit is the one a closeout edge depends on — that is, in RELEASE for any tier, and at the DISCOVERY closeout. Anywhere else, do not touch `gates`.** The closeout checks it
  before resetting to IDLE.
- **In any other phase, do not touch `gates`.** DEFINE, PLAN, CODE and DISCOVERY commit their own
  artifacts (see `.daw/rules/commits.instructions.md`), and if any of them set `commit` the closeout
  gate would be true from the first phase onward and would stop meaning anything. The gate does not
  say "a commit exists" — it says "the release step was completed".

## Language

Write the commit message in the language the user is working in, keeping the Conventional Commits
type, the scope and the trailers as specified above.
