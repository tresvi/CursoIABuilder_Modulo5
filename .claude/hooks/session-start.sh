# Hook: SessionStart — DAW drop-in.
#
# Drop-in: the orchestrator arrives through the `@.daw/orchestrator.md` import in
# the repo's context file, and this hook is defence in depth — it nudges the
# model to RUN the boot sequence and covers the headless case.
#
# Installed as a plugin there is no import to write, so this hook is not defence
# in depth: **it is the only channel**. Its stdout is the one thing that puts the
# orchestrator in front of the model, which is why it now passes the resolved
# method root rather than assuming `.daw/`. A SessionStart's stdout enters the
# context through the harness (system-reminder), bypassing no gate.
#
# What to say, and the concurrent-session check behind it, is the method's
# business and lives in .daw/scripts/session-boot.py — shared by every tool, so
# the two-hour marker cutoff exists once instead of once per adapter.
