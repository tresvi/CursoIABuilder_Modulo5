# Where the method lives, printed on stdout. **The repo wins**: a `.daw/` in the
# project is either a drop-in install or a deliberate customisation of the
# plugin's default, and either way it is the copy the user can read and edit.
# The plugin is the fallback.
#
# This exists once because it was written twice and omitted four times. Two of
# the six hooks resolved both locations; the other four looked only in the repo
# — including session-start, the one that boots the pipeline. Installed as a
# plugin, DAW loaded its skills and its agents and enforced **nothing**: a
# pipeline that looks installed and does not hold, which is the exact failure
# `scripts/acceptance.md` opens by naming. Meanwhile `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` said
# all six handled both.
#
# Returns non-zero when neither location has the method, so a caller can bow out
# rather than build paths under an empty prefix.
